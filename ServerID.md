# Release ID for Jupyterhub

Editing this file triggers a (re)install of the jupyterhub installation.
If the jupyterhub is already installed, it will be refreshed but not forcibly 
upgraded (that needs to be managed from the console). 

There will be errors if the github secrets have not been set up
