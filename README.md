# EMSC-4123 Data Science

Course materials, notebooks, and the computational gadgets behind the scenes

## Using Jupyterbook

This repository also contains the information for building a jupyterbook using the notebooks that are in
the Notebooks directory.

There is some additional configuration to make this work smoothly and you can read what needs to be done 
in [Jupyterbook/README.md](Jupyterbook/README.md)

<!--
For this example, you can see the [online version](https://underworld-geodynamics-cloud.github.io/self-managing-jupyterhub/FrontPage.html) which is automatically built by github using this repository.
-->

## Administration tasks
    
<!--
If the hub has a signup page it can be reached here:
